# FriendFinder
This is a straight forward app. The starter page will let you know that if you are willing to answer a few questions we will match you up with someone who answered those questions in a similar way. 

In the survey it checks that you answered all of the questions. Then compares each of your answers to all of the users who are in the friends array. The best match is then presented to you with their name and picture.
